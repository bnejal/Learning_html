  <h1>HTML Projects Index</h1>
  <p>
    This webpage serves as an index of all my recent html projects with each subsequent project increasing in complexity
    as I learn more about programming. This page will likely evolve as time passes on and as I learn more about html and css.
    I also may begin integrating java functionality into the index.
